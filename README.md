### Project README Overview

The provided scripts form a comprehensive toolset for managing files and directories in a Unix-like environment, with a focus on automation, error handling, and user interaction. Each script serves a specific purpose:

1. **`copy.sh`**: A robust file copying utility with advanced features like recursive copying, forced copying, and detailed logging.
2. **`make.sh`**: A directory creation tool that builds a hierarchy of directories, with rollback capabilities and user interaction for existing directories.
3. **`check.sh`**: A file comparison utility that identifies and reports differences between files in two directories.
4. **`commit.sh`**: An automated Git commit script that streamlines the process of staging and committing changes in a repository.

These scripts are designed to enhance productivity and reliability in file management and version control tasks, making them valuable assets in a variety of development and administrative scenarios.


### `check.sh`
- **Description:** This script appears to be a sophisticated file copying utility for Unix-like systems. It's designed to handle recursive, path-dependent tasks, particularly for copying files from one directory to another while maintaining their directory structure. The script seems to have the following key features:
  - **Recursive Copying:** Capable of traversing directories recursively to copy files and directories.
  - **Force Option:** Includes a '-f' flag to force copying, potentially overwriting existing files.
  - **Path Specification:** Allows specifying paths for copying with a unique syntax, including the use of '!' to indicate full directory copying.
  - **Error Handling and Logging:** Implements checks for valid directories and same-source-and-destination errors, and maintains a log of actions.
  - **Rollback Feature:** Contains a rollback function to undo changes in case of interruption, suggesting a focus on reliability and safety.
  - **Finalize Function:** A finalize function to complete the copying process, ensuring all intended files are copied correctly.

This script is suitable for scenarios where precise control over file copying is needed, especially in environments with complex directory structures. It's a robust solution for backing up or replicating directory trees.

### `make.sh`
- **Description:** This script is designed to create a hierarchy of directories within a specified source directory. Key features of this script include:
  - **Recursive Directory Creation:** It traverses a path argument, creating directories at each level as specified by the user.
  - **Directory Level Counting:** Before proceeding with directory creation, it counts the levels of directories to be created, ensuring the correct structure.
  - **Rollback Capability:** If the script is interrupted, it includes a rollback function to delete any directories created during its run, enhancing its reliability and safety.
  - **Logging and User Interaction:** The script logs its actions in a log file and interacts with the user for confirmations, especially in scenarios like existing directories or during a rollback.
  - **Argument Validation:** It checks for the correct number of arguments and validates the existence of the source directory, preventing user errors.

This script is particularly useful in scenarios where a complex directory structure needs to be set up quickly and reliably, such as in automated deployment or testing environments.

### `check.sh`
- **Description:** This script is a file comparison utility that searches for matching files in two specified directories and checks for differences. The key functionalities of the script include:
  - **Directory and File Matching:** It traverses through the directories to find matching files and then compares them.
  - **Use of `diff` Command:** The script uses the `diff` command to identify and display differences between files.
  - **Recursive Traversal:** Implements a recursive function to deeply search through directory structures.
  - **User Feedback:** It provides clear user feedback, either indicating differences found or confirming that no differences exist.
  - **Error Checking:** The script verifies the existence of provided directories and the correctness of user input.

This script is valuable in scenarios where it's essential to ensure consistency or synchronization between files in different directories, such as in backup verification or content synchronization tasks.

### `commit.sh`
- **Description:** This script is designed to automate the process of committing files and directories to a Git repository. It provides a user-friendly way to stage and commit changes by specifying file paths. The script's functionalities include:
  - **Selective Staging and Committing:** Allows users to specify files and directories to be committed using a custom path syntax, with the option to use '!' to include directory contents.
  - **Recursive Traversal for Staging:** Implements recursive traversal to stage files and directories specified in the path argument.
  - **Logging of Actions:** Records actions in a log file, providing a trace of the script's operations.
  - **User Input Validation:** Checks for the correct number of parameters and guides users on the correct usage of the script.
  - **Git Operations:** Executes Git commands to stage (`git add`) and commit (`git commit`) changes, and optionally push them to a remote repository (`git push`).

This script is particularly useful for developers and teams who need a streamlined and automated process for handling Git commits, especially in projects with complex file structures.
